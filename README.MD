## Calculator project - DOM and JS - Normal Mode

This JS was created on June 14th, 2016.  The goal was to take the HTML provided and write the JS functionality to add the two fields together.

The primary purpose of this exercise was to understand and use addEventListener and querySelector to retrieve and alter information on the HTML.
